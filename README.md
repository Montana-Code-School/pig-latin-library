 for words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial
 vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence, then “ay” is added

 for words that start with a vowel, all you need to do is add “way”
 “ultimate” becomes “ultimateway”

 for words that begins with “y” is treated as a consonant word
 “yellow” becomes “ellowyay”
